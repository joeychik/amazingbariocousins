Proposal

  Our group, Jason and Joey, are proposing to create the game "Amazing Bario Cousins." Our game will be a platformer. As the name
suggests, player has to jump over platforms and obstacles. This program will be made using pygame, a Python module designed for
beginners to program games in Python.
  Our game will be a parody of the popular platformer, "Super Mario Brothers." Because of this, one of our main goals is to include
gimmicks of the original game. For example, instead of mushrooms for powerups, our character may be collecting burgers instead. 
  Similarly to that game, our game will control the character with arrow keys on your keyboard while making our main menu screen
controllable with both keyboard and mouse. Our game consists of 4 basic levels with a simple goal: get to the end of the map without
dying. Things such as ledges and monsters will be able to kill you, though your character can
jump on these monsters to defeat them. Each level has its own obstacles and a time limit. Throughout these 4 levels, the player will
have 5 lives. Each time you die, you lose a life. The final level will have a boss fight. You won't be able to defeat it using the same
method as before. Instead, the character will be required to survive its attacks, get past it and press a button. The player rescues the
princess and everyone lived happily ever.

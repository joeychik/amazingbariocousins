Proposal

Our group, Jason and Joey, are proposing to create the game "Amazing Bario Cousins." Our game will be a platformer. As the name
suggests, player has to jump over platforms and obstacles. This program will be made using pygame, a Python module designed for
beginners to program games in Python.

Our game will be a parody of the popular platformer, "Super Mario Brothers." Because of this, one of our main goals is to include
gimmicks of the original game. For example, instead of mushrooms for powerups, our character may be collecting burgers instead. 

Similarly to that game, our game will control the character with arrow keys on your keyboard while making our main menu screen
controllable with both keyboard and mouse.

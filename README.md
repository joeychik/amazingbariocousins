# proposal (will copy and paste later)
Our group, Jason and Joey, are proposing to create the game "Amazing Bario Cousins." Our game will be a platformer, a parody of the
popular game, "Super Mario Brothers." Similarly to that game, our game will control the character with arrow keys on your keyboard. We
plan on making our main menu screen controllable with both keyboard and mouse. Our game consists of 4 basic levels with a simple goal:
get to the end of the map without dying. Ledges, monsters,  Each level has its own obstacles and a time limit. Throughout these 4 levels, the player will
have 5 lives. Each time you die, you lose a life.

Jason:
1. pong
2. frogger
3. snake
4. pac man

Joey:
1. pongs a nice game
